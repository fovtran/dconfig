Qt designer plugin

# If you want to develop Qt stuff for FreeCAD, you'll need the Qt Designer plugin that provides all custom widgets of FreeCAD. Go to:
	freecad/src/Tools/plugins/widget

# So far we don't provide a makefile -- but calling

	qmake plugin.pro

#creates it. Once that's done, calling

make

# will create the library libFreeCAD_widgets.so. To make this library known to Qt Designer you have to copy the file to $QTDIR/plugin/designer

# Making a debian package

dh-make
devscripts

#optional, used for checking if packages are standard-compliant
lintian
debuild

#replace by the name of the package you just created
lintian your-fresh-new-freecad-package.deb
